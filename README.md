# TG-Claw-40k-PvE-AI
This is a recent (as of 05/29/2019) TG-Claw branch which has been edited and upgraded to play like a Warhammer 40k/Aliens/SS13 Crossover. The main goal is to fight swarms of enemies with absurdly OP weapons, while still retaining the possibility for larger RP and maintaining SS13's systems and glory (tisms) in-tact!
